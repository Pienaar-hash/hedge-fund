## 2️⃣ Batch 3 Verification Tests (what to actually run / inspect)

Think of these as “sanity drills” rather than just `pytest` green.

### A. Automated tests (CLI)

You already ran the ones Codex listed; I’d re-run them once after any manual tweaks:

```bash
# Core risk / router integrity
python -m pytest \
  tests/test_risk_limits.py \
  tests/test_screener_tier_caps.py \
  tests/test_router_smoke.py \
  tests/test_router_policy.py \
  tests/test_router_metrics_effectiveness.py -q

# Core execution & config surface
python -m pytest \
  tests/test_risk_limits.py \
  tests/test_screener_tier_caps.py \
  tests/test_exchange_dry_run.py \
  tests/test_router_smoke.py \
  tests/test_order_router_ack.py \
  tests/test_order_metrics.py \
  tests/test_config_parsing.py -q

# Telemetry/dashboard-focused (if not part of a suite above)
python -m pytest \
  tests/test_state_publish_stats.py \
  tests/test_dashboard_metrics.py \
  tests/test_router_health_v2.py -q
```

If any of these fail, we treat that as a hard stop before Batch 4.
