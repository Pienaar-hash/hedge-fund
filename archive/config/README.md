# Archived Configurations

These JSON configs lived in `config/` before v5.9.2 but are no longer part of the live runtime. They remain here for historical reference only.

- `firestore_schema.json`: Legacy dashboard/telemetry schema used before the Firestore mirror refactor. The current code auto-discovers schema and no longer reads this file.

If you need to inspect these old settings, read them from this directory—do not move them back into `config/`.
