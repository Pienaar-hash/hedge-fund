You are a coding assistant working on the GPT-Hedge v6.0-rc branch.

Objective
- Harden documentation and tests to reflect the v6.0-rc runtime after the VERSION, router auto-apply resilience, and pipeline warmup patches.
- Reduce drift risk by explicitly encoding key invariants in tests and updating the v6 docs/audits.

Context
- Previous batches:
    - Batch01: VERSION file bump and basic engine_version checks.
    - Batch02: router_autotune_apply_v6 more robust to missing/stale risk allocation state.
    - Batch03: pipeline_v6_compare_summary gains warmup semantics (is_warmup, warmup_reason).
- v6 contracts:
    - v6_runtime_telemetry_contract.md
    - v6_state_contract.md
    - v6_risk_engine_contract.md
    - v6_intel_contract.md
    - v6_router_autotune_contract.md
    - v6_pipeline_shadow_compare_contract.md
- Audits:
    - infra_v6.0_runtime_final_audit.md
    - infra_v6.0_telemetry_audit.md
    - infra_v6.0_intel_audit.md
    - infra_v6.0_pipeline_audit.md
    - v6.0_known_issues.md

Files in scope
1) Docs
   - v6_runtime_release_notes.md
   - v6.0_known_issues.md
       - Remove or soften items that are fully addressed by earlier batches:
           - VERSION mismatch in telemetry.
           - Router auto-apply stalls without allocator state, once the resilience patch is in place.
           - Pipeline compare sample cap warmup semantics, once is_warmup is implemented.
       - Keep the sync_state zero-equity behaviour either as-is (if unchanged) or reword as a low-severity operational caveat.
   - v6_runtime_telemetry_contract.md
       - Ensure engine_version and v6_flags are explicitly listed as required fields in synced_state.json and nav telemetry, aligning with the updated tests.
   - v6_pipeline_shadow_compare_contract.md
       - Document the is_warmup/warmup_reason fields and usage.
   - v6_router_autotune_contract.md or infra_v6.0_intel_audit.md
       - Document the new router auto-apply behaviour for missing/stale risk allocation state.
   - infra_v6.0_runtime_final_audit.md
       - Add short notes that:
           - VERSION mislabel has been fixed and now forms part of the test gate.
           - Router auto-apply resilience has been improved with explicit logging for missing/stale allocator state.
           - Pipeline compare summary now distinguishes warmup vs steady-state metrics.

2) Tests
   - tests/test_v6_runtime_activation.py
       - Assert v6_runtime_probe.json contains:
           - A non-empty engine_version in the synced_state (if this test reads synced_state) OR
           - At least that v6 flags are present as today; do not over-constrain to specific tag strings.
   - tests/test_executor_state_files.py
       - Assert that synced_state.json includes:
           - items list
           - nav float
           - engine_version (non-empty)
           - v6_flags dict
           - updated_at
   - tests/test_pipeline_v6_compare_runtime.py
       - Ensure tests align with the new warmup semantics added in Batch03.
   - tests/test_router_autotune_apply_v6.py
       - Ensure coverage for:
           - Missing allocator file (resilient behaviour).
           - Stale allocator file (resilient behaviour).
           - Fresh allocator file with defensive risk_mode (hard block preserved).

Constraints
- Do not introduce brittle tests that hard-code specific VERSION tag strings.
- Keep doc changes minimal and focused: annotate new behaviour and remove obsolete warnings, but do not rewrite large sections.

Acceptance criteria
- pytest for the following passes:
    - tests/test_v6_runtime_activation.py
    - tests/test_executor_state_files.py
    - tests/test_pipeline_v6_compare_runtime.py
    - tests/test_router_autotune_apply_v6.py
- v6.0_known_issues.md only lists issues that remain genuinely open.
- Runtime + telemetry docs match the actual behaviour of the patched code: engine_version presence, router apply resilience, and pipeline warmup fields.
