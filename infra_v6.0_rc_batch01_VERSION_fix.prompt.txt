You are a coding assistant working on the GPT-Hedge v6.0-rc branch.

Objective
- Fix the engine VERSION mismatch so telemetry and dashboards correctly show the v6.0-rc engine label instead of the old "v0.3.0-testnet-exit 2025-08-24" fallback.

Context
- The runtime executor reads the VERSION file into _ENGINE_VERSION in execution/executor_live.py and embeds it into synced_state and nav telemetry.
- Current audits and v6.0 Known Issues highlight that VERSION still points at an old tag, so all telemetry is mislabeled.
- v6 contracts require engine_version in state files to be accurate for auditability.

Files in scope
1) VERSION
   - Update the contents to the desired tag, e.g. "v6.0-rc 2025-11-XX" (keep the pattern: "<tag> <date>").
2) execution/executor_live.py
   - Inspect _ENGINE_VERSION to ensure it reads VERSION as today (no behavioural change needed unless a hard-coded default is present).
3) tests/test_v6_runtime_activation.py
   - Loosen / extend the test so that:
     - It asserts engine_version is present in v6_runtime_probe/synced_state.
     - It asserts engine_version != "v6.0-beta-preview" and != empty.
     - It does NOT pin to a specific tag string, to avoid breaking future releases.
4) tests/test_executor_state_files.py
   - Confirm that synced_state.json includes engine_version and v6_flags, and that engine_version is non-empty.

Changes to make
- Bump VERSION to a v6.0-rc tag.
- Ensure executor_live.py does not override VERSION with a hard-coded fallback except when VERSION is genuinely missing.
- Strengthen tests as described so we catch missing or fallback engine_version without freezing the exact tag string.

Out of scope
- No behavioural changes to trading logic, risk, router, or intel.
- No changes to Supervisor or config files.

Acceptance criteria
- Running pytest on:
    tests/test_v6_runtime_activation.py
    tests/test_executor_state_files.py
  passes.
- At runtime, logs/state/synced_state.json shows engine_version matching the new VERSION file and includes v6_flags.
- v6_runtime_probe.json continues to record the same flag set as before.
