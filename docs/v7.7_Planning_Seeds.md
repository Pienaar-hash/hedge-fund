# v7.7 Planning Seeds

Potential themes and features for the v7.7 release cycle. These are seeds for discussion, not commitments.

---

## Theme 1: Multi-Exchange Router

**Goal:** Extend router to support multiple exchanges beyond Binance.

**Potential scope:**
- Exchange abstraction layer in `order_router.py`
- Per-exchange precision and rate limit handling
- Cross-exchange arbitrage signal integration
- Unified state surfaces for multi-venue positions

**Risks:**
- Increased complexity in execution loop
- State coherence across venues
- Exchange-specific edge cases

---

## Theme 2: Portfolio Engine

**Goal:** Move from per-position sizing to portfolio-level optimization.

**Potential scope:**
- Mean-variance optimization with factor constraints
- Risk parity allocation across tiers
- Dynamic tier rebalancing based on vol regime
- Correlation-aware position sizing

**Risks:**
- Increased computational overhead
- Sensitivity to covariance estimation errors
- Complexity in backtest validation

---

## Theme 3: Enhanced ML Integration

**Goal:** Activate dormant ML modules in `execution/ml/`.

**Potential scope:**
- Feature engineering pipeline
- Model training and evaluation harness
- Shadow mode integration with live signals
- Gradual weight blending with rule-based factors

**Risks:**
- Model drift and recalibration requirements
- Increased dependency on data quality
- Complexity in debugging

---

## Theme 4: Advanced Risk Engine

**Goal:** Extend risk engine with additional risk measures.

**Potential scope:**
- Expected shortfall (ES) limits
- Liquidity-adjusted VaR
- Stress testing scenarios
- Intraday margin monitoring

**Risks:**
- Data requirements for stress scenarios
- Computational overhead for real-time limits
- Calibration complexity

---

## Theme 5: Operational Tooling

**Goal:** Improve developer and operator experience.

**Potential scope:**
- Interactive CLI for position inspection
- Live factor decomposition in dashboard
- Automated performance attribution reports
- Enhanced alerting with escalation policies

**Risks:**
- Scope creep
- Maintenance burden

---

## Theme 6: Documentation & Onboarding

**Goal:** Improve documentation for new team members.

**Potential scope:**
- Architecture diagrams (Mermaid/PlantUML)
- Developer onboarding guide
- Runbook library for common ops tasks
- Glossary of domain terms

**Risks:**
- Documentation drift
- Time investment

---

## Prioritization Discussion

TBD based on:
- Investor feedback
- Operational pain points
- Engineering capacity
- Risk/reward analysis
