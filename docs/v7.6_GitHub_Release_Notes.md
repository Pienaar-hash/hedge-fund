# GPT-Hedge v7.6 Release Notes

## Highlights

**v7.6 — Institutional Execution & Telemetry Release**

A stability and observability release focused on execution quality metrics, factor governance, state contract hardening, and operational visibility. No new alpha strategies introduced; emphasis on reliability and transparency.

---

## Engine Improvements

### Router Microstructure (P1)
- Per-symbol slippage, latency, and TWAP usage tracking
- Quality scoring with slippage drift and latency buckets (GREEN/YELLOW/RED)
- `router_health.json` v2 with global + per-symbol metrics

### Hybrid Scoring & Vol Regime (P2)
- Vol regime factor integrated into hybrid alpha scoring
- Regime-aware sizing adjustments
- Router quality factor penalizes symbols with degraded execution

### Factor Diagnostics (P3)
- Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization removes factor redundancy
- Factor covariance/correlation matrix computation
- IR-based auto-weighting with configurable bounds and EMA smoothing

---

## Telemetry

### Exit Pipeline & Ledger Authority (P4)
- Unified position ledger as canonical source for positions + TP/SL
- Ledger-registry reconciliation with mismatch breakdown
- Exit coverage metrics and underwater-without-TP/SL detection

### NAV & Risk Snapshot Coherence (P5)
- NAV anomaly guards with max jump detection
- DD state machine (NORMAL/DRAWDOWN/RECOVERY) with flap detection
- VaR/CVaR computation with configurable limits

---

## Risk

- NAV freshness veto for stale data
- DD flap prevention with state machine
- VaR/CVaR breach flags in risk snapshot
- Enhanced exit coverage monitoring

---

## Dashboard

### Regime Strip (P6)
- Unified state loader with consistent error handling
- Regime badges for Vol/DD/Router/Risk regimes
- Color-coded status indicators

---

## Tests

- Full suite: **1314 passed, 47 skipped**
- All integration, unit, and schema tests green
- `make pretag-v7.6` validation target added

---

## Upgrade Notes

### Pre-Upgrade
```bash
make pretag-v7.6
python scripts/runtime_sanity_check_v7_6.py
```

### Deployment
```bash
sudo supervisorctl restart hedge:
```

### Post-Activation Checks
1. `logs/state/*.json` timestamps fresh
2. `engine_metadata.json` shows `version: v7.6`
3. Dashboard regime strip renders correctly
4. Router health metrics populated
5. Exit coverage > 90%

---

## Rollback

```bash
git checkout v7.5
sudo supervisorctl restart hedge:
```

State surfaces are forward-compatible. v7.5 reads v7.6 state files successfully (ignores new fields).
