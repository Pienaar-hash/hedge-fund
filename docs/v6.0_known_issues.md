# v6.0 Known Issues (rc)

1. **Pipeline compare warmup** – Compare summaries now expose `is_warmup`/`warmup_reason`/`min_sample_size` (see `logs/state/pipeline_v6_compare_summary.json`). Treat snapshots with `is_warmup=true` as informational until enough samples accumulate to flip into steady state.
2. **Sync_state skips nav writes on zero equity** – `_sync_once_with_db()` (`execution/sync_state.py:1145-1159`) skips Firestore writes when `nav_total_equity <= 0`. On cold start this can postpone nav exposure in Firestore/dashboards until the executor recreates `logs/nav_log.json` with non-zero equity.

Track these items during the rc period and adjust configs/scripts accordingly.
