GPT-Hedge v7.6 represents a significant infrastructure upgrade focused on institutional-grade execution quality and operational transparency. This release introduces comprehensive router microstructure tracking, enabling precise measurement of slippage and latency across all traded symbols. Enhanced factor governance through Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization and IR-based auto-weighting improves signal quality and reduces factor redundancy. The unified position ledger provides authoritative tracking of all positions with associated risk parameters. NAV anomaly guards and a drawdown state machine add additional layers of risk control. All changes have been validated through a comprehensive test suite with over 1,300 passing tests. No new alpha strategies are introduced in this release; the emphasis is on reliability, transparency, and operational safety—foundational improvements that support long-term performance stability.
