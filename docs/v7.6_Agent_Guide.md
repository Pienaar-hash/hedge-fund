- Manifest: `v7_manifest.json`

## Patchset Workflow
1. Load architecture, state contract, diagnostics, manifest.
2. Confirm scope and invariants (single-writer, atomic state).
3. Plan → Apply → Validate (`make test-fast`; runtime tests if state/telemetry) → Document → Hand-off.
4. Update docs/manifest when adding/changing state surfaces.
5. Keep trading/risk logic untouched unless explicitly scoped.

## Safety Rails
- Respect single-writer rule; no direct writes to `logs/state` outside executor/state_publish/sync_state.
- No new state surfaces without manifest + state contract updates.
- Tests: fast lane required unless docs-only; runtime lane when touching state/diagnostics.
- Do not alter risk/router/trading semantics unless authorized track.

## Handoff
- Use patchset template to summarize objective, files, risks, tests, acceptance criteria.
- Note any skipped tests and why.
- Leave clear next steps for following agents.
