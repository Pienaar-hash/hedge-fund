st.markdown("""
This panel is designed to display live or simulated trade executions, position tracking, and alerts.
In future phases, this could connect to:
- Exchange APIs (Binance, KuCoin, etc.)
- Risk dashboards (position sizing, leverage, exposure)
- Real-time logging of trades and fills

For now, this serves as a placeholder.
